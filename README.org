* Obtaining
  The project is designed to work with [[http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]]. Supposing
  you have default Quicklisp configuration, the location of
  your local projects is in =$HOME/quicklisp/local-projects=
  clone this repository using Git:
  
  : cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
  : git clone https://github.com/wvxvw/cl-whitedb.git

  The project should now be accessible for use with:

  : (ql:quickload :cl-whitedb)

* Installing
  Beside the Lisp part, you would need to download and compile
  [[http://whitedb.org/install.html][WhiteDB]]. Follow the link for step-by-step instructions.
  The CFFI bindings that locate the shared library can be found
  in [[./src/bindings.lisp][bindings.lisp]]. Modify this file if you have =libwgdb.so=
  installed in a place not listed there.

* Running
  TBD

* Features
  There are several different approaches to accessing the database
  that I'm trying to pursue:

** Thin wrapper around C API
   /Status: Mostly finished, untested./
   
   This is the one to one translation of *WhiteDB* C API into Lisp.

** Sequence traversal
   /Status: Some work has been done./
   
   The code dealing with traversing the contents of the database
   as if it was a sequence of values resides in =cl-whitedb.sequences=
   package. It provides tools similar to standard Lisp sequence
   traversal: mapping, reducing, finding.

** Zipper tree traversal
   /Status: Planned./
   
   Zipper is an interesting [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_%2528data_structure%2529][data structure]], designed by GÃ©rard Huet.
   It is used for traversing trees in any direction. The code
   implementing this data structure resides in =cl-whitedb.zipper=
   package.

** Structures
   /Status: Some work has been done./
   
   An attempt to provide struct-like macros for defining complex
   data structures using same storage engine. This code resides
   in =cl-whitedb.structures= package.

** Search
   /Status: Planned./
   
   Informed and uninformed search algorithms that search the dabase
   using selected strategy.
   
* Testing
  /Status: No tests so far./
  
  In order to test the installed library execute:

  : (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op :cl-whitedb)
